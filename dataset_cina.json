    "gt": "On the night of June 3 and 4, the People’s Liberation Army stormed the Square with tanks, crushing the protests with terrible human costs. Estimates of the numbers killed vary. The Chinese Government has asserted that injuries exceeded 3,000 and that over 200 individuals, including 36 university students, were killed that night. Western sources, however, are skeptical of the official Chinese report and most frequently cite the toll as hundreds or even thousands killed. Similar protests that had taken place in other Chinese cities were soon suppressed and their leaders imprisoned.",

In response, the people of Hong Kong took to the streets in record-breaking numbers. On one day, 16 June, up to 2 million people marched peacefully in the streets of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong police have responded to the protests with batons, tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and water cannons. Although the Extradition Bill has now been dropped, the movement has evolved into a much wider call for change and protests in Hong Kong continue.",

According to an archived human rights report shared by the U.S. state department in 2015, China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television said \"The Big Bang Theory\" and the other shows in question may have violated a clause in its online broadcasting rules — one that prohibits violence, porn, and \"content that violates China's constitution, endangers the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, provokes trouble in society, promotes illegal religion, and triggers ethnic hatred.\"",
