      "gt": "On the night of June 3 and 4, the People’s Liberation Army stormed the Square with tanks, crushing the protests with terrible human costs. Estimates of the numbers killed vary. The Chinese Government has asserted that injuries exceeded 3,000 and that over 200 individuals, including 36 university students, were killed that night. Western sources, however, are skeptical of the official Chinese report and most frequently cite the toll as hundreds or even thousands killed. Similar protests that had taken place in other Chinese cities were soon suppressed and their leaders imprisoned.",

In retaliation, Marines forced a nearby taxicab to stop and ordered the driver and his four student passengers out of the vehicle. Sgt. Frank Wuterich then executed the five men in cold blood. Another Marine then desecrated their bodies, including by urinating on them. Wuterich then ordered his men to 'shoot first and ask questions later', and they went house to house killing everyone they saw. They killed seven people in the Walid family home, including a toddler and an elderly couple. Next, the Marines killed eight people in the Salim family home, six of them children. Finally, the troops executed four brothers in a closet in the Ahmad family home. For years, the military tried to keep these photos of the aftermath from the public. Only in March 2024 american journalists obtained and released photos showing the grisly aftermath of the bloody rampage.",

On average, 83% of people subjected to force across those jurisdictions were unarmed, the agencies reported. Black people were subject to overall police use of force at a rate 3.2 times greater than white people in 2022, according to the report. That disparity is more severe than lethal force trends; Black people were killed by police at 2.6 times the rate of white people in 2022. Americans’ confidence in the police increased in 2024 eight percentage points over 2023 to 51%",

Pros: the bill is crucial for protecting youth from mental health challenges. Pediatricians across the nation have spoken out about the urgent need to create a healthier digital environment for children and adolescents; Autonomy. Addictive algorithms keep kids endlessly scrolling. There is currently no mechanism for opting out of recommendation algorithms. Supporters argue that providing parental controls and disabling features like algorithmic recommendations would provide parents and kids with more autonomy over their online experiences, allowing them to gain greater control over their usage times; KOSA is an important step toward holding companies accountable for the harm they cause. They emphasize that Big Tech companies have designed social media to maximize profit by exploiting children’s developmental vulnerabilities for commercial gain. Cons: potential censorship of online content. Many conservatives argue that empowering the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with censorship authority could lead to the suppression of legitimate speech; Many liberal legislators are concerned with KOSA’s Duty of Care provision, which requires companies to “prevent and mitigate” harms to children such as bullying, violence, and negative mental health impacts. They worry that this provision could lead to the censorship of LGBTQ+ content and reproductive health content as companies over-filter content to avoid legal repercussions; Critics maintain that the provision remains too broad and vague, potentially leading to censorship of crucial information; Critics argue that by restricting access to lawful speech on topics such as addiction and bullying, KOSA may hinder minors from finding supportive online communities and feeling comfortable in their identities.",
